*_STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION CODE. PORTIONS OF THE PUBLIC FACE ARE SUBJECT TO ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE AT ANY TIME_*

After the latest commit, everything seems functional. There are still some bits which are specific to the app I'm developing which uses this framework contained in the code, but those should be coming out in the next release.

Required Packages:

Newtonsoft.Json

Microsoft.bcl.async
