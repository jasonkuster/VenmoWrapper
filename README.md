VenmoWrapper
============

This is a C# wrapper for the Venmo service. Originally written for Windows Phone 8, but currently released as a portable class library for WP8, Windows Store, .NET 4+, and Silverlight 5.

*_STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT, SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION CODE_*

After the latest commit, it _might_ work. It _might_ also eat your children and kill your sheep and burn your house down and punch your puppy. As of right now, it is 150% untested and may just crash on run. I wrote code that I think makes sense, but I can't know until I try it, and school is breathing down my neck. Will have an update in a few days.
